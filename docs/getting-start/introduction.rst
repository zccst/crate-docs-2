What is OKChain
------------------


OKChain is a group of open source blockchain projects developed by OKEx, aiming to promote the implementation of large-scale commercial applications based on blockchain technology. It gives every participating node the right to enjoy the same status, allowing users to publish and run a variety of decentralized applications, issue their own digital assets, create their own digital asset trading pairs, and trade freely. , The cross-chain technology it uses is the key to achieving value landing. Through the cross-chain module, the value intercommunication, user intercommunication, and scenario application intercommunication of the blockchain can be realized simply and efficiently, and finally the co-construction of the ecosystem can be realized, and the value-added system can be constructed.



OKChain is used to provide users with a more
comprehensive credit enhancement service given that efficiency issues
have been solved, and to cater for usersâ€™ demand for credit enhancement
services while they trade crypto assets.

What is OKChain-openDEX
----------------------------

OKChain-openDEX, as the first project of the OKChain ecosystem, is a middleware that can freely issue DEX. With the design concept of "everyone can send DEX", it provides various basic functions needed to operate a DEX. Compared with traditional DEX, it adopts full on-chain matching and on-chain order book management to make matching information more transparent and safe. At the same time, compared with Ethereum-based projects, the matching engine based on OKChain's collective bidding can achieve second-level matching , Similar to the operating experience of a centralized exchange. In addition, its unique design idea is not to build a DEX belonging to a certain stakeholder, but also to provide a platform to achieve the separation of technology and operations, just as Ethereum reduces the threshold for digital asset issuance through smart contract technology. OKChain uses openDEX Lowered the threshold for operating digital asset trading pairs.

OKChain CLI
----------------------------

``okchaincli`` is a command-line interface that lets you interact with the OKChain. gaiacli is the only tool that supports 100% of the OKChain features, including accounts, transfers, delegation, and governance. Learn more about ``okchaincli`` with the \ `delegator's CLI guide <>`__ .


Running a full-node on the OKChian Testnet
--------------------------------------------------------
In order to run a full-node for the OKChain Testnet, you must first install ``okchaind``. Then, follow `the guide <>`__.

If you are looking to run a validator node, follow the \ `validator setup guide <>`__.
